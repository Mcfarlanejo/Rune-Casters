## Concept
Rune Casters is an idea I had for a game where the player can make their own spells. The spells have random stats based on their element and amount, with 10 of a specific Rune guaranteeing a max roll. The style is Rogue-Like as the player moves around the map killing enemies for loot who also drop items with Random stats. This side of things is inspired by ARPG games like Diablo.

## Game Loop
Currently, the core game loop consists of moving around and killing enemies for loot, crafting better spells until you die, then you are able to restart. This is simple but expandable if I had more time I was going to make levels but it took longer than expected to make the core mechanics which I wanted to be modular and scalable for the future.

## Interaction
Players use basic twin-stick movement, left for rotation and right for shooting projectiles. There are 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen. The first 2 are for your projectiles, only one of which can be active at a time. The 3rd is the AOE or Area Of Effect spells which cause a damaging ring to appear and expand taking out enemies close by. The 4th one is the self spell which causes a stat boost based on the element of the spell. The player starts with a basic fire spell and several runes of each type to make some new spells. The menu buttons on the side navigate the player through the inventory, spellbook menu, and crafting menu which allow the player to customize their items or spells. The pause button brings up a pause menu.

## Art Style
The art style uses basic Kenny assets, I wasn't able to find suitable assets for the spells due to complexity.

## Sound
There are basic sound effects and music that are used to give some atmosphere to the game.

## Known Bugs
- If you move into your own projectiles they will disappear. No damage will be taken.
- AOE spells can be pushed around by the player.
- Buttons used to exit in-game menus can sometimes take a while to close the menus making them feel unresponsive
